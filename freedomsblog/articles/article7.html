                    <p>Managing money is one of the most important skills you can develop. The financial choices you make in your 20s, 30s, and 40s can significantly impact your long-term comfort and security. While mistakes are normal, recognizing common pitfalls can help you avoid costly errors and build a stronger financial foundation.</p>
                    <p>In this article, we'll highlight key mistakes for each decade of life, along with practical solutions, real-life examples, and tips for achieving financial stability. Whether you’re just starting your career or planning for retirement, these insights will help you make informed decisions.</p>

                    <h2>In Your 20s: Laying the Foundation</h2>
                    <p>Your 20s are a time of freedom, experimentation, and learning. Many young adults focus on immediate experiences—travel, social life, and new purchases—often neglecting long-term financial planning. The biggest mistake is delaying savings, believing “there’s plenty of time later.”</p>
                    <p>Starting small is better than not starting at all. Even modest contributions to a savings account or retirement plan can grow significantly over time thanks to compound interest. Additionally, building credit responsibly is essential; a strong credit history will open doors for loans, renting apartments, and even employment opportunities in the future.</p>
                    <p>Living beyond your means is another common trap. Social pressures and flashy lifestyles can tempt young adults into unnecessary debt. Creating a budget, tracking expenses, and prioritizing essential spending will help you stay on track. Financial literacy is equally important—understanding loans, investments, and taxes early can prevent costly mistakes later.</p>

                <section>
                    <h2>In Your 30s: Building Stability</h2>
                    <p>In your 30s, financial responsibilities often increase. Careers advance, families grow, and expenses rise. Many fall into lifestyle inflation, spending more as they earn more, which can erode savings if not managed carefully. Adjusting your budget to match your evolving income is critical for maintaining financial health.</p>
                    <p>Having an emergency fund becomes especially important in this decade. Unexpected events—medical bills, car repairs, or temporary unemployment—can disrupt finances. A separate account with 3–6 months of living expenses acts as a safety net, preventing reliance on high-interest debt.</p>
                    <p>It’s also the time to increase retirement contributions and reduce debt. Focus on paying off high-interest loans, maximize employer retirement matches, and consider additional accounts like Roth IRAs. Proper insurance coverage—health, disability, and life—is another essential step to protect your assets and family.</p>

                <!-- Section: In Your 40s -->
                <section>
                    <h2>In Your 40s: Securing the Future</h2>
                    <p>By your 40s, retirement planning, children’s education, and wealth accumulation become central. Not having a clear retirement plan can jeopardize your long-term goals. It’s essential to assess current savings, estimate future needs, and create a structured plan, possibly with the guidance of a financial advisor.</p>
                    <p>Healthcare costs tend to rise, and failing to prepare for them can strain savings. Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) or long-term care insurance are useful tools to manage medical expenses in retirement. Estate planning is equally important—wills, trusts, and beneficiary designations protect your family and assets.</p>
                    <p>Parents often prioritize their children’s education over their own retirement. While education is important, neglecting retirement is risky. Balance contributions between retirement accounts and education savings. Additionally, maintain a diversified investment portfolio to balance growth with risk, ensuring financial stability for the decades ahead.</p>

                    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
                    <p>Avoiding common financial mistakes across your 20s, 30s, and 40s can significantly improve your long-term stability. Start saving early, adjust your budget with income changes, and protect yourself with insurance and emergency funds. Plan for retirement proactively, and educate yourself continuously.</p>
                    <p>Consistency, planning, and informed decisions will empower you to navigate financial challenges confidently. By applying these strategies, you can build a secure, comfortable future for yourself and your family, avoiding unnecessary stress and setbacks along the way.</p>
