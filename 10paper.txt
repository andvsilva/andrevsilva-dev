 Even though I'm making more money than I have ever made before, my personal spending is probably the 
 lowest it has ever been And one of the reasons for that is because I'm focusing more and more on 
 things that genuinely matter to me And that means that at this stage of my life, if it's not making me 
 happier, it's not making me healthier Or it isn't getting me any closer to my financial goals, then 
 I am not buying into it So in today's video, I'm going to share with you some of my favourite purchases 
 that have had the biggest impact to my life in these three categories First, on my list, is my trusty 
 journal slash planner. I started journaling way back Way, way back and I can't quite explain how much 
 writing things down and having a journal has impacted my life It's made me more mindful, more focused 
 and more intentional with what I do And there is so much evidence to show how powerful journaling and 
 self-analysis can be for your development I use my journal in two ways Firstly, as a self-analysis 
 tour, I log down on my experiences, my insights, my ideas, whenever it comes to my mind And secondly, 
 I use it as a weekly planner to have a clear focus on my top priorities and my non-negotiable every 
 week The second thing on this list is a specific book and it's the midnight library by Matt Hague Matt 
 Hague, he's run so many books, he is the most productive person ever But this one specifically is my 
 favourite, it's a super good book for anyone who needs to pick me up and is going through a challenging 
 time It's basically a self-help book and motivational book but disguised as fiction The midnight library 
 takes you through a journey with a woman who gets to the end of her life And she finds herself in this 
 library where each book represents a different life that she could have lived Had she made a slightly 
 different decision at a point in her life The character, Nora, she dips in now all of these books and 
 you follow her into her journey seeing these different lives And it reminds you of the joys found in 
 living and that no life is perfect of itself Next on my list, which is probably to no surprise to 
 anyone who has watched a few of my YouTube videos and it's this black top And I love it so much that 
 I have two or the exact same ones It's just the classic black top so why do I love it so much other 
 than it being incredibly comfortable and incredibly warm Well, it's made my life so much easier when 
 it comes to recording YouTube videos as it's just one less decision that I have to make And I apply 
 this concept in so many areas of my life, I try to limit the amount of decisions I need to get something 
 done And I think that this is such an important part of being able to stay consistent When it comes to 
 YouTube, I don't have all the time to just spend recording videos So I create my environment in a way 
 that makes it a no brainer for me to take action So I have my camera set up, I have my tripod set up, 
 I have my lights set up It doesn't move, a big part of staying consistent is to remove as many 
 restrictions and objections in doing the tasks that I need to do So this has been a massive help 
 in me staying consistent on YouTube The fourth thing on my list is outsourcing This isn't a specific 
 item, there's just something that I'm spending more and more money on these days And it gives me back time, 
 it gives me back energy, and it gives me back brain power If you watch my other videos, you know I talk 
 about the dollar value of my time And it's something that I've implemented in the last two years after 
 reading the book The Almanac by Naval Ravikant He says we should set an aspirational hourly rate on our 
 time And then anything that I can outsource for less than that hourly rate, I try an outsource set So for 
 me this really applies to household stuff like assembly furniture, cleaning, the amount of high mental
  energy we have in a day is scarce So I pass me, try and spend it doing the big take items that will make 
  the most difference to my life And then any free time that I have, I just use it to chill Next on my list 
  is another one of my favourite purchases And it has something that's freed me up so much time without 
  breaking my bank account And without I want to introduce the sponsor of today's video Who I am so excited 
  to be working with because I have been consuming their products for a while now And that is fuel Over the 
  past few months I have become very, very reliant on fuel and more specifically their essential meal And 
  even more specifically their chocolate flavoured wine I'm trying to juggle a lot of different things recently 
  and this has been one of the reasons I've been able to get all my proteins, get all my vitamins, get all my 
  minerals that I need into my diet without sacrificing on my productivity is super quick If you add 500ml of 
  water to the shaker, you add two scoops of this 100% plant-based essential powder You give it a good shake, 
  10 seconds recommended and you're good to go There's no time spent in thinking, okay what am I going to make 
  today? How am I going to get my vitamins and proteins into the meal? Oh I need to clean up now, all of that 
  just disappears, it's just one less thing to worry about And it's also a really affordable one of these meals 
  equates to one pound And if you do like it and if you do want to consider it, then by using the link in my 
  description below you'll also get a free shaker Next on my list is Fast Tech I don't really believe in upgrading 
  stuff just so I can have the latest version I had the iPhone 10 up until four months ago But I do believe in 
  updating your tech if you're using it to make a living because it's one of those things where money out will 
  equal more money in I spend so much of my work day on this desk, on my laptop and the majority of my income streams 
  rely on my laptop So it only makes sense for this to be operating in the most efficient way possible So I feel 
  that investing in good tech or good anything that you need to get the job done faster or to improve the efficiencies
  of your money making stream then it's an over-rener 7th is learning this for me, came after school at school I was more 
  focused on just getting good grades than actually learning and understanding the subject And I guess part of 
  this comes down to the pressures of society that we need to excel We need to get really good grades, we need 
  to get into a good university, we need to get a good job and that whole timeline Rather than the focus on 
  learning and developing as a person and becoming financially lecturer I know the word courses are quite 
  frowned upon but I've paid for so many And I feel like there is a lot of scams out there and that's why 
  people kind of roll their eyes when they hear the word course But investing in the right course can seriously 
  fast track your learning A lot of us are in friend groups or surrounded by people that are in very similar 
  positions to us, they're very similar to us And this makes it that much harder to get that breakthrough if 
  that's what you want Because it makes it more difficult to learn and pick up things than if you were already 
  in that group of circle to start off with You can just learn a lot just by matter of osmosis In this day and age, 
  the information gap is closing thanks to the internet and possibilities and the opportunities are available for 
  more and more people to take up regardless of their background You can learn what's taken someone else years and 
  years to learn in a day or in a week and I think it's amazing and it really should be utilized 9th on my list is 
  my whiteboard that I have up over there I have my overarching goal across the top and then all my actions of the 
  week that will get me closer to there If you watch my video on how I set my goals for this year, link up here if 
  you haven't already But I mentioned in that video how I use a whiteboard to track what I think is the most important 
  part of your goal setting process And that is your lead measures these are the actual things that you are doing every 
  single day Forget the goal just focus on the lead measures So this whiteboard is updated every Sunday night for the week 
  ahead There's one way to stay accountable is by having your task shoved in your face the entire day I've made so many of my 
  friends buy one it's honestly a game changer 9th on this list is something I want to add because I feel like I did a lot of 
  it in my early 20s But I haven't done so much recently and I spend money on experiences and new activities Whether it's 
  taking your weekend out in the countryside trying out a new activity for the first time I would always value spending money 
  towards creating a memory over a tangible item that can be replaced And I really want to make sure that we don't get so caught 
  up in trying to make a living that we forget to live So I guess I'm adding this to this list to make myself more accountable 
  And just like how I spent my early 20s making the best memories with the people closest to me I want to make sure I do the same 
  thing going into my 30s So there's some of my favourite purchases that I've had the biggest impact in my life I love to know 
  what is your single best purchase that has made the biggest impact to your life Thank you so much for watching and I hope to 
  see you in one of my next videos
