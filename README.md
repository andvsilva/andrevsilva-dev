# Welcome to my web page  

Hi, I am developing my personal web page to exercise my skills in programming, in special developing a project is
a good way to learn a new skill doing by yourself. This
project is based on one template available on the internet
that allow me to learn by interacting with the source code
HTML and CSS.
