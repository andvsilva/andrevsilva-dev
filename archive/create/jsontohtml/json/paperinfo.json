Silva", "introduction": "\nI've spent nearly a decade navigating the world of finance and banking and \nI've seen first hand the mistakes people are making day in and day out that \nare stopping them from becoming rich. So in this article I wanted to share with \nyou five of the most commonly overlooked bad habits and tips on how to break out of them. \n", "Scarcity Mindset vs. Growth Mindset": "\nNumber one, a scarcity mindset. There's this really interesting study done \nwith a group of relatively low achieving students. They were split into two groups. \nThe first group was the control group and that group was asked to, together, read out \nloud an article describing how human memory works and then later discuss what they learned.\n\nSo they learned about long-term short-term memory using repetition. The second group was taught \nabout a growth mindset. So they read and discussed an article about how learning makes their \nbrain smarter and discussed how they can apply their learnings in their schoolwork. What they \nfound was a second group who learned about the growth mindset showed a significant increase in \neffort and motivation towards their learning compared to the first group and this increased \nmotivation had a direct correlation to improved performance.", "Skimping on Growth": "\nNumber two is skimping on growth. This is something that I did a lot in my 20s and it's only in \nthe last few years that my perspective in paying for education has completely changed because \nbefore I had this mentality that everything is available on the internet for free. So why should \nI pay for further education or learning? But I could just take the time out to learn those things \nmyself without having to pay for it. I even bought a course that has helped me with my social skills and \nthat is the level of which I pay for learning and development now. Everything you want to learn or \nanything you want to solve or any part of you that you want to develop but don't skimp out on it \nbecause there's only going to cost you in other ways and to really grow and build wealth you need \nto keep investing in your learning and education.", "Doing it all yourself": "\nNumber three doing it all yourself. I saw a motivational quote the other day that read Beyonc\u00e9 \nhas the same 24 hours in the day that we do. Great quote except it missed the fact that our 24 hours \naren't the same and she has the ability to outsource pretty much everything that she could possibly \nthink of and she has a team to run it all. Although we definitely don't have the same 24 hours that \nshe does we can however find ways to achieve more in less time because you don't have to do everything \nyourself anymore and for almost everything I've realized that there is some sort of free tool or sister \nthat can help you do the thing that you need to faster and better.  \n\nAccording to a report by Forbes we spend on average 88% of our work week communicating and written \ncommunication takes up the largest amount of time in that so whether it's writing a persuasive email \nwriting an important document preparing a presentation or a pitch written communication plays a huge \npart in every aspect of our working lives and so the ability to do it well and to do it fast can be \nan absolute game changer.", "Relying on Being Physically Present": "\nNext we have relying on being a physically present. We need to create systems or have investments \nthat generate income without the need for us having to continue to work. This concept is very different \nfrom what most of us are familiar with. We're used to thinking that we need to spend 40 years of our lives working \nand then rely on our retirement funds to live out the remaining years. But in self-going down that route \nif we can look at our active income sources and think how can I turn this into something that won't \nrequire me to be physically present or at least not so involved in five or ten years time then that \nis a way we can start thinking about how to make our money work for us whilst we sleep. Now at the \nstart of your career this is a lot harder to do and most if not all sources of income require either a \nlot of time or a lot of money. But then after that depending on how you play your cards and what you \nfocus on after the initial stages that will did bend dictate your path to financial independence. When \nit comes to investing Buffett's investment philosophy is centered around the idea of buying and holding \na diversified portfolio of high quality companies that can grow over time effectively making money without \nthe need for constant involvement.", "The Garden Hose Theory": "\nNumber five the garden hose theory think of your attention and energy like a garden hose. When the nozzle \nis tightly controlled and directed at a single point the water flow is really strong and it can effectively \nnurture the plant it's aimed at over time. That is like focusing your energy on a few selected tasks at \nleast to affect the results and productive outcomes. If you start poking holes along the hose to water \nmultiple plants at once the water pressure drops the more holes you add the weaker the stream becomes \nfor each task until eventually there's not enough water pressure to be useful for any of the plants and \nthat's the equivalent of saying yes to too many commitments your energy and attention gets bred to them \nand nothing is the full focus it needs to actually thrive with so many opportunities out of fingertips \nso many new ideas so many things to try is tempting to say yes to everything that comes our way \nthinking that we don't do everything we're going to miss out but really during this we'll just slow \nus down you don't need to grasp every single opportunity that comes your way you don't need to try 100 \nthings all at once and we hope that one of them picks up it's a lot more important to have specific \nstrategic focus so there's a five things you need to stop doing to become rich this year thanks for \nwatching if you enjoyed these videos you'll enjoy this video over here on six habits that made me six \nfigures by 24 thanks for watching and see you there.", "": "\nNumber one, a scarcity mindset.

The chances of people reaching their financial goals can be greatly increased by changing their \nperspective from one of scarcity to one of abundance, investing in learning and development, using \nresources rather than trying to do everything on their own, diversifying their sources of income to \ninclude passive streams, and concentrating their efforts on specific tasks.\n"}
