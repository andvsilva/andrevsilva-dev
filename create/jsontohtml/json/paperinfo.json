It's kind of like you're doing bench press, \nyou start off with one plate until you can work your way up to two plates three plates, etc. \nOne of the worst things that you can do is commit to a business idea to venture to an endeavor \nand say that you're gonna give it your all or say that you're gonna push when you know that \neither you don't have the ability or you simply just don't have the Commitment and the hunger \nby the way that is totally fine. It's fine to understand that there are certain opportunities \nthat you simply don't have the appetite for right now and that doesn't mean that you'll \nnever have the appetite for it.", "Seeing is Believing": "\nThe next money secret is that it's never possible until you see it and Either \nyou see it online or even more powerful you see it in person. There are certain \npeople with 250,000 dollars, on their wrist when you look at truly wealthy people \nand you realize, hey Most of times they don't really wear brands most of times, they are \nvery under the radar when you look at wealthy people and you see the way that they move \nand the way that, they act you first of all start to observe it, but you also start to realize \nif your reality is. I can't imagine making more than $50,000 a year and someone is literally \nsitting down with a hundred fifty thousand dollars on their wrist or whatever the number may \nbe it totally changes in its shifts your reality. This is also why if you can just walk \naround affluent, areas whatever the nice area of your city is go there walk around \nsee all the money, see all of the wealth and it will start to sink into your \nsubconscious that it is possible to win!", "Fast Money vs. Slow Wealth": "\nNow the next money secret is aim to make money fast, but build wealth slowly, so listen there's no such \nthing as get rich quick, but there is such a thing as get rich quicker and there's certain vehicles in \nlife where you can get compensated far more for your time, that you put in for the talent and the skill \nthat you develop in that vertical, then you would if you spent a thousand hours working in a different \nindustry, so listen never rush the process, but of course try to make money as fast as possible, try to \nbecome rich as quick as you can, but rich and wealthy are two very different things! so aim to build your \nwealth slowly, because true wealth is only built through years and years and Decades of wisdom of learning \nthe right money lessons, again and again and again, so aim to become rich quick but aim to become wealthy \nslowly because that's the only way that you will keep it! ", "Ignore Financially Illiterate Advice": "\nNumber five is ignore money advice from the Financially illiterate, I truly believe that in this world It \nis a matter of the financially literate and the financially illiterate and it doesn't matter, what background \nand what color race religion whatever it is it doesn't matter where you come from it's simply a matter of \nfinancially illiterate and financially illiterate! but the only difference between us is I made sure that \nI was gonna learn from a young age the language of money, what money is where it comes from how it works? \nSo there are people in your life that have the best intentions for you, the love you they care for you,\nBut you have to ignore their advice, so that way you can take care of not only you, but in future take \ncare of them.", "Money is Energy": "\nNumber six money is energy and energy can never stay stagnant, I see this law where people make money and \nthey are so afraid to spend that money, they're so afraid to circulate that money back into the economy, \nthey're so afraid to release that energy and they're living in such scarcity mindset that they just end \nup losing it all. Somehow or they may not lose it but more money never flows them, money is energy It's \ninflow and it's outflow and that doesn't mean that everything that comes in must go out No, in fact especially \nin your 20s you should be saving and investing majority of the money that you make, but never hoard that \nmoney because if you do, the money becomes stagnant and you have cut off the flow of energy.", "Build Your Peace of Mind Pot": "\nNumber seven is you need to build your peace of mind pot, this is a fun that gives you true peace of mind \nthis needs to be a safety net, where you know that no matter what happens no matter how ambitious how big a risk,\nyou may even take that you always have something to fall back on, I do not believe the money buys happiness, \nBut I believe the money can if you do it right buy you peace of mind and bear mine That doesn't mean making a lot \nof money because the person who makes $200,000 a year and only spends $40,000 and has a very big peace of mind pot \nthat person has far more peace in their life than the person who makes $20 million a year and manages to spend $19 million, \nbecause they're running on such thin margins, they're playing such a dangerous game so from day one if you can build \nyour peace of mind pot. You need to enjoy your life! And if you don't want to enjoy your life go spend it on your loved ones on the \nones that you care about let them enjoy the spoils of your work, but as I said always keep your peace of mind pot.", "Money is an Identity": "\nThe next one is money is an identity and it truly is! I'm telling you right now you could work extremely hard, But if you \nhave the identity of a poor person, it will always chain you in life, you do not get what you deserve you get what you \nthink you deserve, because what you think you deserve dictates your actions and your actions dictate what you actually \nget in life. You know, it's very unfortunate, you see a lot of people in abusive relationships and the reason they stay \nin those relationships is, because they have some part of their Identity that thinks they deserve it, because the crazy \nthing is after they get out of one abusive relationship, They find their way into another so it is ingrained as a part \nof their identity, So you can have something that is as heartbreaking and unfortunate as that. But also from the extreme\nside of things all the way to the person that just has an identity, they are not someone who is worthy or deserving of \nmoney. This is why I was tell people go buy that $12 coffee at the hotel go into these affluent areas and just \nunderstand that these are normal people they move differently. They talk differently. \nThey carry themselves differently, but at the end of the day, these are just normal people now.", "Reputation is Priceless": "\nThe next one is the reputation can never be reborn, so act accordingly in life you need to understand that you will \nalways have the opportunity to make more money, but your reputation is almost impossible to claw back, so the next \ntime you think about f***ing over some business partner or cutting someone out of a deal when you made a promise or \nIn general just making money from dirty means understand that your reputation will live with you for the rest of time, \nyour reputation carries on because just like Chinese whispers People will talk and talk and it will continue to \npermeate, So when you understand their your reputation is probably one of the most fragile things on earth never \never put it at risk, because it's very hard to rebuild!", "Ask the Hard Questions": "\nNow number 10 is that one man's opportunity is another man's downfall, there is a certain business opportunity that \nwill probably make you a billionaire, but will probably wreck my career and vice versa, So just understand that not \nall opportunities are created equal you need to assess an opportunity based on where you are in your career what \nyou're like as a person, you know your strengths your weaknesses as well as your risk tolerance, how averse you are to \nrisk and not only risk, but stress I'm the sort of person that can deal with immense amounts of stress and I just have \nthis ability to take on stress and responsibility because from a young age I had to take care of me and my mom Whereas \nfor another person they may crumble that doesn't mean that they're a bad entrepreneur or a bad business person or whatever \nIt is it just means that they're different so my opportunity could be their downfall So really just understand that concept \nwhen assessing what the next step is for you..", "conclusion": "\nTo finish this article, I give to you 10 lessons about language of money that can truly can change\nyour life!
